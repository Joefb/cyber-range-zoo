This is my side project for RIT's Cyber Range Zoo. 
The Cyber Range Zoo will be a virtual platform for students to practice penetration testing. 
I am working in a team and we are developing automation scripts and code to 
automate the installation of vulnerable software across different operating systems. 

This is a wonderful learning opportunity and I really appreciate RIT letting me be involved.
I will be focusing on:
* BASH scripting
* PowerShell
* Anisible

## Spoiler Alert!
Reading the script files will give away key details of the challenge and may spoil the fun.
